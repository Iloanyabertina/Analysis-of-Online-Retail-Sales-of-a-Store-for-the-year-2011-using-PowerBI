## Data Cleaning and Manipulation
#### Data types was changed, StockPrice column was changed to Text, Unit price was changed to Fixed decimal (Currency).  Null values was filtered out of the fileds in the dataset. 

#### Unit Price less than $0.00 (negative values) was filtered out and sorted in ascending order
![Filter 1](https://github.com/Iloanyabertina/Iloanyabertina.github.io/assets/139617136/bdbceb65-93f0-4922-adcb-acab083af528)

#### Quantity less than 1 (0 and negative values) are filtered out of the dataset and field is sorted in ascending order
![Filter 2](https://github.com/Iloanyabertina/Iloanyabertina.github.io/assets/139617136/87598f1f-fe75-4fed-b27d-bf2d673d48c6)

#### A custom column was created to show the revenue generated ( a calculation of the quantity multiplied by the unit price)

## Data Visualization
![Data Viz 1](https://github.com/Iloanyabertina/Iloanyabertina.github.io/assets/139617136/40db2d97-f87a-4d66-8bc3-4b94a1237d2d)
#### Data Insight and analysis- 1) My analysis shows that there are some months of the year where exceptional growth is witnessed. The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $575k. The increase in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million USD, the highest during the entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December, therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the year.

#### Data Insight and recommendation- 1) The second visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and I’ve been told you’re more focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated. I would suggest that these countries should be focused on to ensure that measures are taken to capture these markets even more.

#### Data insight and analysis- 1) The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 17% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is in a good position.

#### Data Analysis, Insights and recommendation- 1)Finally, the map chart shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with the regions that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.
